# Witcher Project: A Dark Web Crawler and Intelligence Tool
Project Overview: The Witcher Project is a custom-developed tool designed to interact with the dark web, enabling users to extract media and content from hidden services. This tool is particularly focused on crawling and analyzing dark web marketplaces and forums for cybersecurity intelligence. It assists security researchers and investigators in understanding dark web activities, identifying cyber threats, and uncovering potential vulnerabilities and malicious actors.

# Key Features:

Dark Web Crawler: A robust and scalable web crawler designed to navigate and scrape data from .onion websites while respecting the anonymity and security of the Tor network.
Media Extraction: Capable of extracting and processing various media formats (images, videos, text) from dark web platforms.
Content Analysis: Includes modules for content analysis, allowing for the identification of keywords, threats, and relevant cyber intelligence.
Customizable Search: Provides customizable search options to target specific keywords, phrases, or categories across dark web forums and marketplaces.
Technology Stack:

Languages: Python (with BeautifulSoup for scraping and requests for Tor network interaction)
Libraries: Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy for web scraping, and TensorFlow/PyTorch for potential machine learning integrations (if relevant to analyzing the data).
Networking: Integrated with the Tor network for secure and anonymous access to the dark web.
Data Storage: Uses a structured database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB) for storing scraped data, along with a text-based repository for storing URLs and media links.
Applications:

Cybersecurity Research: Enables cybersecurity experts to monitor illegal marketplaces and forums for emerging threats like malware, exploit kits, or leaked credentials.
Threat Intelligence: Helps organizations and law enforcement gather intelligence on potential data breaches, criminal activities, and dark web communications.
Forensics: Assists digital forensics experts in collecting evidence from hard-to-reach dark web resources for investigations.
